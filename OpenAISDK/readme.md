The OpenAI Agents SDK enables you to build agentic AI apps in a lightweight, easy-to-use package with very few abstractions. This uses Reasoning API endpoint.

The Agents SDK has a very small set of primitives:
- Agents, which are LLMs equipped with instructions and tools
- Handoffs, which allow agents to delegate to other agents for specific tasks
- Guardrails, which enable validation of agent inputs and outputs
- Sessions, which automatically maintains conversation history across agent runs
