    "Understanding Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "A transformer is a type of deep learning model architecture introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al. in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" that processes sequences (like text, audio, or time-series data) using a mechanism called self-attention to understand relationships between elements, regardless of their position in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike older models like RNNs or LSTMs, transformers don’t read inputs strictly left-to-right or right-to-left — they look at the entire sequence at once, figuring out which parts are important for each prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms:\n",
    "It’s like reading a whole paragraph and instantly noticing which words are most connected, instead of reading word-by-word and slowly remembering the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query (Q): “What am I looking for?”\n",
    "Key (K): “What do I have to offer?”\n",
    "Value (V): “What’s my actual information?” (this is the vector embedding each word in a sentence has)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q and K give us the probability of how important a word is in a sentence and that probability is dot producted with the V."
