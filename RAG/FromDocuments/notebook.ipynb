Oh dear! I shall be late!\\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards,\\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\n\\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\nin the world she was to get out again.\\n\\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\\ndeep well.\",\n",

First, she tried to look down and make out\\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\\nhung upon pegs.
